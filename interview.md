# Interveiw Preperation

* Tell me about yourself (Can you make an introduction to me?).

  > My name is Wang zhiquan and I am a student learning computer science in Njtech. CS is a really interesting major that I can always make a sense of achievement when I code a app or implement a algorithm.Computer Graphic is one of the most attractive field to me,there are counts of algorithms in CG can build a realistic world and make fun for people which is really exciting.

* Tell something about your major.

  > I'd like to talk more about the game programming experience during these few years.I started to learning Unity Game Engine when I initially get in touch with the game programming.I build lots of game demos which may be not so interesting but I have learned a lot coding skills.After that I took participate in several gamejams which is a party for game development from all over the world.Every time, our team need to develop a game according to a specified topic in 48 hours.I can always discuss with other participants about their ideas and share our ideas about coding and implementing these demos.It is a big challenge for me at the first time that I can hardly develop a game without any serious bug but as I get to gain more experience and have a high level coding skills I can enjoy the party better.

*  Why XXX(our) University? Why do you want to study in XXX(our) University?

* Why do you want to study in USA (for undergraduate/master/phd)

* What's your plane ?

  > I hope to keep focusing on the field of computer graphics in the next year.There are many interesting aspects of cg I'd like to know such as physical based rendering or modeling.I'm now pushing a project that building a modeling system based on voxel which is expected to evolve into a stronger game engine.After graduating,I'm sure to study for a master degree and doing some academic research.Meanwhile I think it is time to get some internship experience.it will be great to work for NVIDIA or Microsoft.

* Please introduce about your background

  > I would like to introduce my background in mathematics. First,I have a deep comprehension of  linear algebra which is a important fundament of CG.Meanwhile I have take participate in twice mathematics competition,and it was a big challenge to establish a mathematical model to explain the data and solve the problem.So I need to use my mathematical skills to overcome these difficulties.Furthermore,I have enrolled a project about image processing which targets at transfer gray image into a colorful pictures.I learned a lot from some related papers and trying to optimize the current algorithm.I did made progress that I image processed by my algorithm looks more normal than before but the problem is it takes too much time to process a image because of its complex algorithm.

* Please describe the XX experience/project/research

* Tell me a challenge you overcome.

  > The most impressive experience of overcoming a challenge is during the competition of mathematical modeling.It was at the second day that I and my teammates tried to restore a image though the scan information.We built a group of large linear equations to find the each pixel of the image.However when solving equations ,we find the time needed to computing by the current algorithm is about one year because of the large data.We are anxious about the problem and the find no way to solve it.Even our instructor had no ideas.Finally I thought of a algorithm called Brazeham which is used to draw line in CG may be helpful.So I improve the algorithm and make it fit the problem we met.After a tough time of coding and debuging ,we got the answer!
